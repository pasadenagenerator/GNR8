# GNR8 CURRENT STATE SNAPSHOT

## Snapshot Date
2026-05-22

## Current Phase
Governance Snapshot Persistence + Audit Timeline milestone (control-plane only).

## Latest Completed Milestone

- Governance Snapshot Persistence + Audit Timeline is deployed and manually verified end-to-end (control-plane only).
- Control-plane layers for provider settings, credential reference contract, provider selection/communicator, job planning, approvals, and execution handoffs are implemented.
- Deterministic Openprovider sandbox adapter and contract/readiness boundaries are in place.
- Explicit execution boundaries are enforced in control-plane artifacts and dry-run paths.
- Provider handoff readiness is testable end-to-end from deployed UI.
- Admin seed flow creates/reuses a deterministic persisted handoff for readiness inspection.
- Readiness inspection displays persisted `handoffArtifact` and reconstructed deterministic `workerPickupEvidence`.
- `workerPickupEvidence.blockedReasons` is normalized to deterministic, operator-readable reasons with no contradictory approval/handoff/planned-job reasons.
- Operator review intent can now be created, persisted, and surfaced from readiness UI.
- Operator review persistence exists via `gnr8_runtime_provider_operator_reviews`.
- Read-only operator review API exists: `GET /api/gnr8/admin/provider-handoffs/[handoffId]/reviews`.
- Admin-only operator review creation API exists: `POST /api/gnr8/admin/provider-handoffs/[handoffId]/reviews`.
- Governance snapshot model exists:
  - `runtime-provider-governance-snapshot.ts`
- Governance snapshot combines:
  - handoff readiness
  - `workerPickupEvidence`
  - operator `reviewSummary`
  - diagnostics
- Governance snapshot fields include:
  - `snapshotId`
  - `handoffId`
  - `correlationKey`
  - `readinessStatus`
  - `executionBlocked: true`
  - `workerPickupEvidence`
  - `reviewSummary`
  - `diagnostics`
  - `createdAt`
- Governance snapshot diagnostics are emitted:
  - `GOVERNANCE_SNAPSHOT_CREATED`
  - `GOVERNANCE_SNAPSHOT_REUSED`
  - `GOVERNANCE_SNAPSHOT_AUDIT_READ`
  - `GOVERNANCE_SNAPSHOT_PERSIST_FAILED_CLOSED`
- Readiness API now includes `governanceSnapshot`.
- Readiness UI now displays a Governance Snapshot section.
- Governance Timeline API is deployed:
  - `GET /api/gnr8/admin/provider-handoffs/[handoffId]/governance-timeline`
- Governance Timeline UI section is deployed.
- Governance snapshot persistence table is deployed:
  - `gnr8_runtime_provider_governance_snapshots`
- Verified deployed governance loop behavior:
  - readiness-test UI creates/reuses deterministic handoff
  - readiness inspection loads `handoffArtifact` and `workerPickupEvidence`
  - operator review form creates persisted review intent
  - operator review summary is displayed from persisted reviews
  - Governance Snapshot is displayed
  - Governance Timeline is displayed
  - Governance Timeline fields verified:
    - `snapshotId`
    - `createdAt`
    - `reviewSummaryStatus`
    - `reviewCount`
    - `readinessStatus`
    - `diagnostics`
  - `executionBlocked` remains `true`
- Example verified values from deployed manual verification:
  - `reviewSummaryStatus`: `pending_review`
  - `reviewCount`: `1`
  - `readinessStatus`: `pickup_not_ready`
  - `executionBlocked`: `true`
  - snapshot reuse observed: `GOVERNANCE_SNAPSHOT_REUSED`
- Future note:
  - deterministic `createdAt` may show epoch values for dev-seed artifacts
  - potential future improvement: add `snapshotCreatedAt` and `persistedAt`

## Current Blocker

- DB readiness is environment-dependent: `gnr8_provider_credential_references` is documented as missing until migration application in target DBs.
- DB-backed repository tests for provider control-plane surfaces depend on DB URL/table availability.

## Next Milestone

- Governance authorization layer (intent-only first; still no execution).

Openprovider:
- sandbox adapter exists
- readiness: ready_for_sandbox
- execution: planning/dry-run only
- liveEligible: false
- Openprovider API calls: not enabled

DB readiness:
- gnr8_runtime_provider_jobs: present
- gnr8_agency_provider_settings: present
- gnr8_provider_credential_references: migration exists, target DB table may still be missing until applied
- approval/handoff migrations exist; target DB application must be verified per environment

## Active Runtime Architecture

- Runtime identity/readiness/resolution models are active and deterministic.
- Provider/DNS/domain layers are active at control-plane level.
- Worker pickup readiness simulation and evidence projection are modeled, but provider action execution remains disabled by policy.

- status dropdown values:
  - `pending_review`
  - `approved_for_future_execution`
  - `rejected`
  - `needs_changes`

- Save review intent action

Required production env flag:
- `GNR8_ADMIN_PROVIDER_HANDOFF_READINESS_SEED_ENABLED=1`

## Execution Boundaries (Current)

- NO provider execution.
- NO sandbox execution.
- NO live DNS.
- NO DNS writes.
- NO queue/Inngest execution for provider handoff readiness inspection.
- NO external registrar calls.
- NO Openprovider API calls.
- NO worker execution for provider actions.
- NO secret reads.
- NO secret resolution.
- Openprovider sandbox planning/dry-run artifacts only. No provider execution is permitted, including sandbox execution. Control-plane metadata and deterministic planning only.
- `approved_for_future_execution` is intent-only and does not authorize execution.
- `executionBlocked` remains `true`.
- governance snapshot is evidence only.
- NO Openprovider/registrar calls.
- NO queue/Inngest/worker execution.

## Worker Pickup Readiness Criteria

Worker pickup readiness required conditions:
- handoff_status_ready
- non_live_environment
- has_planned_jobs
- approval_status_approved

Blocked when:
- live environment
- handoffStatus blocked
- unapproved blocked handoff
- executable provider handoff with no planned jobs

Clarifications:
- readiness model exists
- worker pickup evidence is deterministic and reconstructable from persisted handoff artifact
- blockedReasons are normalized: no contradictory approval/handoff/planned-job reasons; reasons remain deterministic and operator-readable
- worker execution is not enabled
- this is pre-worker control-plane only

## Current DB/Schema Readiness State

Missing (until migration applied in target DB):
- `gnr8_provider_credential_references`

Present (migration-defined baseline):
- `gnr8_runtime_provider_jobs`
- `gnr8_agency_provider_settings`
- `gnr8_runtime_provider_operation_approvals`
- `gnr8_runtime_provider_execution_handoffs`
- `gnr8_runtime_provider_operator_reviews`
- `gnr8_runtime_provider_governance_snapshots`

## Open Decisions (Needs ADR Before Live Execution)

- Live provider execution gate release criteria.
- External registrar/API execution policy and audit boundary.
- Worker execution enablement criteria for provider actions.
